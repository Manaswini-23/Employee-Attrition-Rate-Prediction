# Employee-Attrition-Rate-Prediction
### Project Overview:
This project addresses a machine learning classification problem with the objective of predicting the rate of employee attrition in the current scenario based on various features. This classification problem was tackled using three algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Notably, the Random Forest algorithm achieved a high accuracy score of approximately 0.97.

### Methodology:
To achieve the project goals, the following steps were meticulously carried out:

1. **Import Libraries and Read Dataset:**
   - Essential libraries were imported, and the dataset was loaded for analysis and model building.

2. **Describe the Dataset:**
   - An in-depth examination and summary of the dataset were conducted to understand its structure and content.

3. **Data Transformation (Categorical to Numerical):**
   - Categorical variables were transformed into numerical equivalents to facilitate model training.

4. **Data Cleaning and Feature Selection:**
   - The dataset was cleansed to handle missing values, outliers, and irrelevant features. Significant features were selected for model training.

5. **Split the Dataset into Train and Test Sets:**
   - The dataset was divided into training and testing subsets to evaluate model performance effectively.

6. **Machine Learning Modeling:**
   - Three classification algorithms were employed:
     - **Logistic Regression:** Applied to predict probabilities and classify outcomes.
     - **Decision Tree:** Used for its simplicity and interpretability in making predictions.
     - **Random Forest:** Utilized for its ensemble learning capability, leading to higher accuracy.

7. **Train the Model (Fit):**
   - Each model was trained using the training dataset to learn the underlying patterns and relationships.

8. **Test the Trained Model (Prediction):**
   - The trained models were tested on the testing dataset to make predictions and evaluate performance.

9. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Model performance was assessed using various metrics. Random Forest stood out with an impressive accuracy score of 0.97, indicating its robustness and effectiveness in predicting employee attrition.

This comprehensive approach ensured a thorough analysis and the identification of the most effective algorithm for predicting employee attrition, ultimately enhancing decision-making and strategic planning.
